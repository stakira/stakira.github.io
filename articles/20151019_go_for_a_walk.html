# Go for a Walk

It's getting a little chill. I went for a walk in the afternoon, alone, which is pretty rare. Suddenly I realized that I haven't done so for a long time, I mean, walk alone in a cool wind.

Walk in a cool wind brings me in a special mood. It's calming. It's an escape. It brings a unheard song. This time, it brought me the memory of dusks and dawns, in different cities and countries. One should not forget where he has been, what he was in, just like one should not forget who he is. Not only the facts, but also the feelings. They need to be refreshed.
