# Generator-Free Static Blog

Ok. Eventually, my blog is up.

It took quite some back and forth, before I find a solution than I can like. The last time I looked, a overwhelming number of static site generator are out there. However, I found they often use a markup language to create templates. I find this practise defeating its own purpose. Not only learning the new language takes effort, also all the templates and config files brings distractions to the workflow, which already has a lot.

Rrecently I found <a href="http://strapdownjs.com" target="_blank">strapdown.js</a>, which is basically a script that use <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked" target="_blank">marked.js</a> to parse markdown written in html. This was exciting, since it reduced a lot of overhead from blog article html files. This method is also search engine friendly, since all the content are in html, parsed or not. However I found strapdown.js outdated and use a very old version of bootstrap. I cannot find the correct document for it. Fortunately, the mechanism is very simple, and can be implemented simpler. So I rolled my own, which also creates navbar and footer for me.

Besides marked.js, I also used <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank">highlight.js</a> and <a href="http://malko.github.io/l.js/" target="_blank">l.js</a>. You probably already know the first one so I'll skip it. l.js basically is a js/css loader. With its help, the overhead in each html can be reduced to minimum. The end result, is one line of javascript and one `<xmp>` element for markdown (it doesn't work very well with `<pre>` element).

Now I still have to create the article list page, which is basically a list of titles and links. I couldn't find a static, generator-free, and search engine friendly way to do this. And there is probably no such way. It is also not really like a typical blog, which usually has multiple articles on one page and use pagination. Eventually I decide I'm OK with all these.

If you like static sites, and find generators tedious, you may wanna try something similar to what I have done.
