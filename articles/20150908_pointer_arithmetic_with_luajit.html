# Pointer Arithmetic with LuaJIT

Lua is designed to be simple. This 'simple' has many meanings. It's a language with only a handful of features but still very expressive. Its features can be implemented efficiently. It works with C easily.

LuaJIT takes the last one even further, by introducing a FFI which feels like cheating.

So pointer arithmetic with LuaJIT is pretty simple:

    local array = ffi.new('int[?]', size)
    local array_ptr = ffi.cast('int*', array)
    local array_ptr = array_ptr + 1
    print(array_ptr[0])

Note here `'int[?]'` here is a type called VLA (variable length array), which is one of the `ctype`s of LuaJIT FFI. `'int*'` is a different type. You can cast a VLA to a pointer using `ffi.cast`. Then pointer arithmetic is pretty straight forward. This pointer can still be used with `[]` indexing, just like in C.

And below is an example, which I actually use, and is originally a cool trick in C.

    function bytematrix(w, h)
        local data = ffi.new('unsigned char [?]', w * h)
        local data_ptr = ffi.cast('unsigned char*', data)
        local mat = ffi.new('unsigned char *[?]', w)
        for i = 0, w - 1 do
            mat[i] = data_ptr + i * h
        end
        return data, mat
    end

This function creates a byte 2d array of width `w` and height `h`. `data` is a 1d array which holds the actual data in a continuous space of memory. `mat` is the pointer can be indexed intuitively, in the form of `mat[x][y]`. Note that you need to keep the reference of `data` to avoid garbage collection.

Indexing out of range is still unsafe, and may not give out any error information. So be careful.

It seems to be (less than 2x) slower than its equivalent in C. So pushing it into a C library through FFI is a good idea if necessary. I have a C library version in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/stakira/26c4323e3d78ab01aeb7).
