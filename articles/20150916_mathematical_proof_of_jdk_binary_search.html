# Mathematical Proof Of JDK Binary Search

In JDK, an interesting implementation of binary search is provided. I'm talking about `Arrays.binarySearch` here. The particular clever part is the return value:

> Returns:

> index of the search key, if it is contained in the array; otherwise, (-(insertion point) - 1). The insertion point is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first element greater than the key, or a.length if all elements in the array are less than the specified key. Note that this guarantees that the return value will be >= 0 if and only if the key is found.

It's super clear to see we have a insertion point or the actual number is found. I find it a bit unintuitive how `low` is guaranteed to be insertion point. So I'm writing this blog to try to prove it, mostly for my own understanding and record.

The source code below can be found in `src/share/classes/java/util/Arrays.java`.

    private static int binarySearch0(int[] a, int fromIndex, int toIndex, int key) {
        int low = fromIndex;
        int high = toIndex - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) >>> 1;
            int midVal = a[mid];

            if (midVal < key)
                low = mid + 1;
            else if (midVal > key)
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                return mid; // key found
        }
        return -(low + 1);  // key not found.
    }

Of course, this kind of proof calls for induction.

- **Base case 0**: Array of zero elements, which is allowed by Java. Since `low=0` and `high=-1`, it doesn't even go into to the loop. Fucntion immediately exit with `low=0`, which is the correct insertion point.

- **Base case 1**: Array of one elements. It may be the target, or not. The search start with `low=0` and `high=0`. Then `mid=0`. If `midVal` is the target, the algorithm is obviously correct. If it is smaller than target, we return with `low=1`, which is the correct insertion point. If it is larger than target, we return with `low=0`, which is again correct. Proved.

- **Inductive step**: Assuming algorithm is correct for array of length less than or equal to `n` where `n>=1`. For an array of length `n+1`, we start with `low=0` and `high=n`. If `n` is odd, `mid=(n-1)/2`, otherwise `mid=n/2`. If target is found in this loop, the algorithm is obviously correct. In the next loop, there are four cases. If `n` is odd, `low=(n-1)/2+1,high=n` or `low=0,high=(n-1)/2-1`. If `n` is even, `low=n/2+1,high=n` or `low=0,high=n/2-1`. In these cases, the new length well be `(n+1)/2` or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, or `n/2` if `n` is even. Either way, the new length is guaranteed to be an integer larger than or equal to 0, and smaller than or equal to `n`. So the next loop (recursion) should find the correct result **if and only if the result is in the subarray**. How is that guaranteed? It's obvious if the target is actually in the array. If it's not, the correct insertion point is still inside or at one end of the subarray. Therefore, proved.

Note how we start with `n>=1` in the inductive step, or length 2, and why we need the base case of `n=0`. It's due to the nature of binary search having to deal with odd and even length arrays differently. It does feel a bit wierd. We can actually make `n=1` and `n=2` the base cases for a language that does not allow zero length arrays, and get the same proof.

Another thing is, the induction proof applies on recursion. This code is presented as iterative, but I believe you can see how it could be translated to recursive.

There is another things I noticed. First, as long as `low` and `high` are not equal, `mid` is never `high`, but can be `low`. This means in each recursion, `high = mid` will work for loop condition `low < high`, but `low = mid` will cause dead loop. If loop condition is `low <= high`, even `high = mid` could end up with dead loops. Down sizing must be guaranteed in each recursion.

If we opt `low < high` as loop condition, and `low = mid + 1` and `high = mid` in each loop, the search could still be done, like this:

    private static int binarySearch0(int[] a, int fromIndex, int toIndex, int key) {
        int low = fromIndex;
        int high = toIndex - 1;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) >>> 1;
            int midVal = a[mid];

            if (midVal < key)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid;
        }
        return low;
    }

However, there can not be an indication of found or not, unless you test it afterwards. Since termination condition is `low < high`, the equal test could be skipped. We will have to look at `low` value, it works correctly, but only when the target is in the array. Use it as the insertion point is not reliable. So this works best when you know the target exist.

The benefits? The returned index never goes out of bound. It doesn't need a return in loop. It's a safer play, especially when you are searching something other than the value. For example, in a rotated sorted array, something like [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3], you can use this to find the rotation point.

    int low = 0, high = a.length - 1;
    while (low < high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (a[mid] > a[high])
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid;
    }
    int rotated = low;

`low` will point to the smallest number. This is hard to get right using `high = mid - 1`, since `high` could be moved to the maximum value, which overshoots.
