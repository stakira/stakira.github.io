# My New Blog

Ok. Eventually, my new blog is up. Well, not really a 'new' one, since there is no 'old' one.

There is a reason for it. The whole web development is pretty counterproductive. Its major languages have two markup languages, which are quick when the need is simple, but can be super complex and yet barely expressive. The other language, which is otherwise a superb language, has such a broken library management mechanism, that you will often see entire external library copy pasted. Let me stop here. I probably have just saved 2000 words. Basically, I don't wanna be a skilled scavenger before I can work on something.

There are also a overwhelming number of static site generator out there, which seemed to be promising. So I investigated Jekyll. Too bad it uses a mini language, which once again is more of a markup language. My comfort zone with markup languages doesn't go any further than Markdown.

And reently, I eventually found what I want: <a href="http://strapdownjs.com" target="_blank">strapdown.js</a>. It use Markdown, which is my favorite. It uses Bootstrap, which (almost) saves me from CSS. It is static, good for Github pages. It is a single Javascript file, so I can hack it as I want, without fiddling with (one of) your favorite workflow tools. Forgive me that I selectively ignore the fact that it has three libraries copy pasted inside.

This is very closed to what I have dreamed. Yes, I had a dream, that no web page need another language or a framework to be generated, since all these can be done with js on client side. And guess what I don't care if you web browser is overloaded.

Of cause, this dream ends as soon as you have dynamic contents.

I downloaded strapdown. Now the site is up. If you look at the source code of this page, it has almost nothing other than my rambling. I recommend it if you enjoy this level of simplicity.

Long live slugabed-ness the nature of human beings!

Uh, I mean simplicity and elegance. You know it, right?
