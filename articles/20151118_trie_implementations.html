# Trie Implementations

The name trie comes from its use for re**trie**val. It is pronounced like "try" by some, like "tree" (the pronunciation of "trie" in "retrieval") by others. It is also called a prefix tree.

So, I expect you already roughly know what is a trie. A trie not only can be used for string loop up, but also could be used to store values associated to string keys. Just like a `set` vs a `map`.

The advantage of trie is, the cost of lookup is `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of keys. In other word, **it's performance is independent of collection size**.

### Array of child pointers

```none
“tree, “trie”, “algo”, “all”, and “also”
     .
    / \
   /   \
  a     t
  |     |
  l     r
 /|\   / \
g l s e   i
|   | |   |
o   o e   e
```

This is the most straight forward implementation of trie.

```java
class TrieNode {
    TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[128]; // for ASCII charset
    boolean wordends = false;
    public TrieNode() {}
}

public class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            int key = word.charAt(i);
            if (curr.children[key] == null)
                curr.children[key] = new TrieNode();
            curr = curr.children[key];
        }
        curr.wordends = true;
    }

    public boolean search(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            int key = word.charAt(i);
            if (curr.children[key] == null)
                return false;
            curr = curr.children[key];
        }
        return curr.wordends;
    }
}
```

The first observation would be the 128-length array is somewhat wasteful. Given our natural languages, a lot of sequences are not valid, which lead to low utilization no matter how heavy use it is. If we use only a-z, we could shrink to a 26-length array, but not likely less. We are also out of luck if we need to support utf-8, unicode, etc. So another choice is using a HashMap.

```java
class TrieNode {
    Map<Character, TrieNode> map = new HashMap<>();
    boolean wordends = false;
    public TrieNode() {}
}
```

Again `HashMap` is a pretty heavy data structure. There are more compact implementations.

### Linked list

```none
“tree, “trie”, “algo”, “all”, and “also”
.
|
a--------->t
|          |
l          r
|          |
g-->l-->s  e-->i
|       |  |   |
o       o  e   e
```

Instead of using an array or a hash map to store children, this implementation store children as a linked list. This kind of tree is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-child_right-sibling_binary_tree" target="_blank">doubly chained tree</a>. It's compact in space but sacrifices traversal speed.

```java
class TrieNode {
    char tag = 0;
    TrieNode next = null, children = null;
    boolean wordends = false;
    public TrieNode() {}
    public TrieNode(char _tag) { tag = _tag; }
}

public class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (curr.children == null)
                curr.children = new TrieNode(word.charAt(i));
            curr = curr.children;
            while (curr.tag != word.charAt(i)) {
                if (curr.next == null)
                    curr.next = new TrieNode(word.charAt(i));
                curr = curr.next;
            }
        }
        curr.wordends = true;
    }

    public boolean search(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (curr.children == null)
                return false;
            curr = curr.children;
            while (curr.tag != word.charAt(i)) {
                if (curr.next == null)
                    return false;
                curr = curr.next;
            }
        }
        return curr.wordends;
    }
}
```

### Ternary search tree

A ternary search tree is like a BST, except each node has three children. These three children are called `equal kid`, `lo kid` and `hi kid`. Each node also stores a character it is representing. While searching a string, we compare the current character to the character of node. If smaller, we move to `lo kid`. If larger, we move to `hi kid`. Otherwise we move to `equal kid`, and start to search for the next character in string.

```none
“tree, “trie”, “algo”, “all”, and “also”
      .
      |
      t
    / |
   /  |
  a   r
  |   |
  l   e
  |   |\
  l   e i
 / \    |
g   s   e
|   |
o   o
```

We can see the ternary search tree as a hybrid of trie and BST. The `equal kid` is a real child node in the same meaning of a trie, while `hi kid` and `lo kid` are not. While moving to `hi kid` or `lo kid`, we are searching the current character in a BST. While moving to `equal kid`, we are actually moving to another binary earch tree for the next character in string.

```java
class TrieNode {
    char tag = 0;
    TrieNode lo = null, eq = null, hi = null;
    boolean wordends = false;
    public TrieNode() {}
    public TrieNode(char t) { tag = t; }
}

public class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (curr.eq == null)
                curr.eq = new TrieNode(word.charAt(i));
            curr = curr.eq;
            while (word.charAt(i) != curr.tag) {
                if (word.charAt(i) > curr.tag) {
                    if (curr.hi == null)
                        curr.hi = new TrieNode(word.charAt(i));
                    curr = curr.hi;
                } else {
                    if (curr.lo == null)
                        curr.lo = new TrieNode(word.charAt(i));
                    curr = curr.lo;
                }
            }
        }
        curr.wordends = true;
    }

    public boolean search(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (curr.eq == null)
                return false;
            curr = curr.eq;
            while (word.charAt(i) != curr.tag) {
                if (word.charAt(i) > curr.tag) {
                    if (curr.hi == null)
                        return false;
                    curr = curr.hi;
                } else {
                    if (curr.lo == null)
                        return false;
                    curr = curr.lo;
                }
            }
        }
        return curr.wordends;
    }
}
```

Ternary search tree is more compact. No memory is wasted. However operations could be slower. Like a BST, ternary search tree preformance is affected by how balanced the tree is. A balanced ternary search tree should be faster than a linked list based trie.

### Bitwise trie

Bitwise trie is a binary tree using single bit keys, instead of character keys, for children. It's very cache-local and friendly to out-of-order CPUs, therefore very fast.
